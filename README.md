# Automated-Serverless-Billing-Receipt-Delivery-System-on-AWS




## **🚀 Introduction :**
In today’s fast-paced digital world, delivering a seamless and secure customer experience is more important than ever. As companies scale, tasks like manually sending monthly billing receipts to hundreds (or even thousands) of customers quickly become unmanageable, error-prone, and inefficient.

To address this challenge, I designed and implemented an Automated Serverless Billing Receipt Delivery System on AWS — a fully automated solution that eliminates manual intervention and ensures every customer receives accurate, timely, and professional billing receipts each month.

This project leverages the power of AWS serverless services — including S3, Lambda, SQS, and SES — to create a fully event-driven, scalable architecture. By uploading a simple CSV file to an S3 bucket, the system automatically parses and processes each customer’s billing data, calculates total charges, formats a detailed plain-text receipt, and securely sends it to the customer’s email address.



# **🏗️ System Architecture :**

The **system is entirely serverless and relies on the following AWS services** :

 - **Amazon S3** : Stores uploaded CSV files containing customer billing data.

 - **AWS Lambda (Parser Function)** : Parses the CSV, groups services by customer, and sends messages to SQS.

 - **Amazon SQS** : Decouples data processing and ensures reliable delivery of customer-specific data.

 - **AWS Lambda (Worker Function)** : Picks up customer data from SQS, formats a personalized email body, and sends it.

 - **Amazon SES (Simple Email Service)** : Sends billing emails to each customer.

This architecture allowed me to build a scalable and cost-efficient pipeline that can handle varying workloads without worrying about server management.
