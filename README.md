# Automated-Serverless-Billing-Receipt-Delivery-System-on-AWS




## **🚀 Introduction :**
In today’s fast-paced digital world, delivering a seamless and secure customer experience is more important than ever. As companies scale, tasks like manually sending monthly billing receipts to hundreds (or even thousands) of customers quickly become unmanageable, error-prone, and inefficient.

To address this challenge, I designed and implemented an Automated Serverless Billing Receipt Delivery System on AWS — a fully automated solution that eliminates manual intervention and ensures every customer receives accurate, timely, and professional billing receipts each month.

This project leverages the power of AWS serverless services — including S3, Lambda, SQS, and SES — to create a fully event-driven, scalable architecture. By uploading a simple CSV file to an S3 bucket, the system automatically parses and processes each customer’s billing data, calculates total charges, formats a detailed plain-text receipt, and securely sends it to the customer’s email address.
